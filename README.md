## The Problem ü§î

Have you ever bought a new foundation or lipstick, only to find it looks completely different at home than it did in the store? You're not alone. Many beauty enthusiasts struggle to find products that match their unique style and enhance their features. Visiting physical stores often involves dealing with misleading lighting, persuasive sellers, and sanitary concerns. Online shopping, while convenient, lacks the assurance that a product will actually suit you. This leads to frustration, wasted money, and a drawer full of unflattering products.

## The Solution ‚ú®

Our app, **Choramatch**, provides a simple yet powerful solution. By leveraging the power of **Machine Learning**, our app analyzes your features to determine your personal color season (e.g., Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer). Once your season is identified, the app recommends a palette of colors that will make you shine. This enables you to make informed and confident purchasing decisions, ensuring you always look your best.
